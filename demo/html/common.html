            The simplest form of using the grid is to assign the module 'trNgGrid' as a dependency to your module and then use the 'tr-ng-grid' directive on a table element.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obviously you also need to pass in the array of items you wish to be listed in the grid,
            and that is achieved by assigning the 'items' attribute to a property on the current scope that represents the array of items.

            The array will get data bound so any change in the array will get automatically detected by the grid.
