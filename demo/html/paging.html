                        By default, all the items in the data array are displayed on a single page in the grid. Scrollbars can be manually added through CSS.<br/>
                        If you wish to activate paging, you must set the <em>page-items</em> attribute. Paging is applied after the data was filtered through the global search filter, the column search filters, and finally after applying sorting.
