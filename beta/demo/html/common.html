<div ng-controller="TrNgGridDemo.TestController" class="row" ng-init="generateItems(10)">
        <div class="panel panel-primary">
            <div class="panel-heading">
                &lt;TABLE&gt;
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-7">
                        <p>
                            The simplest form of using the grid is to assign the module <em>trNgGrid</em> as a dependency to your module and then use the <em>tr-ng-grid</em> directive on a table element.
                        </p>
                        <pre>angular.module("trNgGridDemo", ["trNgGrid"])</pre>
                        <p>
                            Obviously you also need to pass in the array of items you wish to be listed in the grid,
                            and that is achieved by assigning the <em>items</em> attribute to a property on the current scope that represents the array of items.
                            <br />
                            The array will get data bound so any change in the array will get automatically detected by the grid.
                            <br />
                            Don't forget to include Angular JS as a dependency, plus a theme from Bootswatch or the default Bootstrap CSS.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-warning">In this version, jQuery was removed as a dependency.</p>
                        <pre id="trNgGrid_Sample_Common">
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            Sorting, global filtering and per-column filtering are active by default.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-5" project-markup-to="#trNgGrid_Sample_Common"><table tr-ng-grid items="myItems"></table></div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
