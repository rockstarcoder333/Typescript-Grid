### The development of the trNgGrid has stopped in favor of [Smart Table](http://lorenzofox3.github.io/smart-table-website/), which has better traction, backing, and is using an identical philosophy as the one behind trNgGrid.

#### [Documentation and demo site](http://moonstorm.github.io/trNgGrid/release)

#### Installation
- `npm install tr-ng-grid --save` or
- `bower install tr-ng-grid --save` or
- download the grid from the master branch, which contains the latest release. The files you're interested in are `trNgGrid.min.css` and `trNgGrid.min.js`. 

Make sure you first include Angular and a Boostrap theme of your choice. 
Themes can be found on the Bootswatch website. 
Of course you can craft your own, as the grid layout is quite easy to style.

#### Legend
- Release: master, gh-pages/release
- Experimental: beta, gh-pages/beta
